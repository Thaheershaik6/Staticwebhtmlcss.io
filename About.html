	    <h4 class="p-4">5 Reasons Why Web Development Is Still Important</h4>

	    &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;<b>1.Maintaining Ownership</b>
	    <p class="p-4 text-justify">It’s critical to protect your brand identity by owning your web address and website. This will avoid surrendering control of your brand to a third party website and their ads. Remember, owning your own domain name and using a reputable host company is just as important as choosing the domain name itself. Owning your domain name is vital to your business, brand and online presence. Not only does it build your brand, it also makes people more likely to engage with your website.</p>

	    &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; <b>2.Control Your Content With Good Web Development</b>
	    <p class="p-4 text-justify">The old adage that “Content is King” still rings true to this day, possibly even more than before. How you present your content is just as important. Make sure content is original, relevant and interesting to effectively get your message across. With good web development, you control the user experience, manage content relevancy and your conversion process.Good content is what sets your website apart from everyone else and delivers the right message to your customers. Website content always begins with proper market research where you identify your high-value customers (HVC).</p>

	    &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; <b>4.Attracting Search Traffic</b>
	    <p class="p-4 text-justify">Good web development means a fully optimised website which plays a vital role in attracting valuable search engine traffic.

		<h3 class="h3-colour"> &nbsp; &nbsp;  3.Types of web development</h3>
		<h4 class="p-4">Here are the three main types of web development:</h4>

		 &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; <b>1.Front-end web development</b>
		 <p class="p-4 text-justify">Front-end web development is responsible for the look and feel of a website. This means how colors, type, icons, and images appear. Increasingly, front-end development has to account for how a website looks on all devices, from desktop to tablet to phone. Typical programming languages include HTML, JavaScript, and CSS. Front-end developers keep up with cutting-edge trends in web design and development to make sure websites are optimized for users and search engines — and with security best practices in mind.</p>

		 &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; <b>2.Back-end web development</b>
		 <p class="p-4 text-justify">Back-end web development is responsible for building and maintaining the code that runs a website. This code connects the website to the server and ensures that data flows properly to the website and that transactions are processed correctly. Typical programming languages include Java (different from JavaScript), PHP, and MySQL; newer tools include Python and Golang. Back-end web developers can keep up with changes in technology by participating in networking communities that share coding tips and support.</p>

		 &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; <b>3.Full-stack web development</b>
		 <p class="p-4 text-justify">Full-stack web development covers both front-end and back-end responsibilities. Depending on the complexity of a website, a full-stack developer may be responsible for all facets of its development, from the server side to the user interface. Many full-stack developers may still specialize in one aspect of web development, but their broad experience is useful in troubleshooting or speeding up a build or redesign. Full-stack developers are often responsible for identifying cutting-edge technologies, such as enhanced programming languages (or even no- or low-code trends) and blockchain, that can be used to strengthen websites’ business capabilities.</p>
